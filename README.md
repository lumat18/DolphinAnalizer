# DolphinAnalizer
## Introduction
The application enables the user to analyze and calculate the main parameters of the breasting dolphin structure.  
[Breasting dolphins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_(structure)) are important harbor facilities, used in oil and gas terminals. The structure's function is to bear the forces of the berthing vessel.  
The program calculates the internal forces in the dolphin's pile system during the ship approach. Load from the mooring lines of the ship being pushed by the wind is analyzed too.  
The calculation method uses several non-linear equations, which are solved with the algorithms implemented in C#.

## Motivation
DolphinAnalizer is a WPF desktop application that I created as the main part of my Master’s Thesis at the Gdańsk University of Technology.  
The thesis subject was „Analysis of breasting dolphin structure with the use of object-oriented programming in C#”. The thesis got an A mark.  
I focused more on the equations and calculation method at that time, and learn C# especially for the occasion. The code may not fulfill all the good practices. However, the application does its job and solves a very interesting engineering problem. Since I graduated from Civil Engineering, this project was a link to software development.
